# MediTables

This repository is for Meditables, a 200 image camera-captured dataset of medical reports with table annotations. Two tables types are common in healthcare documents which we have referred to as a T1 type table (conventional) and a T2 type table (key-value pairs). The dataset can be accesed here: https://zenodo.org/record/5048287#.YNzazBMzZhE

In this repo, we also provide pre-trained models in this repo for localizing these tables.
